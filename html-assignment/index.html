            <p>Hi, my name is Elvis Zak Masembe. I'm from Uganda, Kampala, and grew up loving music and technology, together with swimming. I was enrolled in the programme of <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> on the 28<sup>th</sup> of December 2024. I have a background as a Computer Technician, where I enjoy working on creative and technical projects that challenge me to grow. I'm also currently working on improving my skills in public speaking. Beyond my professional interests, I find joy in exploring nature, ice skating, and embracing diverse cultures through travel.</p> 

            <p>
                In my free time, I love listening and vibing to music, especially <em>tracks from <strong>Drake</strong></em>, as it inspires and energizes me. My goal is to become a successful web developer. I am also passionate about making meaningful connections and contributing positively to my community. My ultimate goal is to create impactful solutions that improve lives and leave a lasting legacy of innovation and compassion. I'm always eager to learn and connect with new people!
            </p>
